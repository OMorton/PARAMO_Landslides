# PARAMO_Landslides

## Proposed workflow

### Data
1. Infrastructure layers - IN HAND
2. Landslide susceptibility layers - IN HAND per department
3. Cost of install/repair for infrastructure - IN Grima et al. 2020
4. Opportunity cost of cash cropping - NEEDS COLLATING

### Methods
Use the susceptibility layer and the road network layers to extract the susceptibility of the road at each point within an appropriate buffer area (planning for 50, 150, and 300m). This gives us the susceptibility of the land within 150m of the national road network.
Use the forest/no forest layer to focus on just the buffered area that does not have forest already present. This then gives a smaller area that currently has no forest growth bordering the road area.
